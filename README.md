OP-1/LMN-3 interface based on the RP2040.
Current QMK firware is very basic (only midi keyboard implemented 53-76, encoders and analog are not working)
If you want to help the encoder pins are:
Encoder #(A,B) 1(25, 24) 2(22, 23) 3(29, 28) 4(21, 20)
Joystick Analog pins: 26, 27
Known Issues:
	-Joystick switch trace was not connected
