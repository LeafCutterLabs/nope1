OP-1/LMN-3 interface based on the RP2040.<br>
![](Media/v1top.jpg)
Current QMK firmware is very basic (only midi keyboard implemented 53-76 and the LMN-3 CC signals, encoders and analog are not working)<br>
If you want to help the encoder pins are:<br>
Encoder #(A,B) 1(25, 24) 2(22, 23) 3(29, 28) 4(21, 20)<br>
Joystick Analog pins: 26, 27<br>
Known Issues:<br>
	-Joystick switch trace is not connected<br>
 ToDo:<br>
 	-Get Vial running
